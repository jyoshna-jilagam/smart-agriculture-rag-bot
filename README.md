#  Smart Agriculture Crop Process Explainer Bot

>  Responsible AI-powered RAG system for Agricultural Education  
>  Safe • Domain-Restricted • Retrieval-Grounded • Hackathon Ready

##  Overview

The **Smart Agriculture Crop Process Explainer Bot** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot designed to explain crop lifecycle stages and farming processes in simple, easy-to-understand language.

This system strictly avoids:
-  Fertilizer recommendations  
-  Pesticide advice  
-  Treatment guidance  
-  Yield prediction  

It demonstrates **ethical and responsible AI deployment in agriculture**.

---

#  Problem Statement

- Agricultural documentation is often technical and complex.
- Farmers may lack structured understanding of crop lifecycle stages.
- Extension officers repeatedly explain the same processes.
- Generative AI systems may provide unsafe advisory content.

There is a need for a **safe, educational AI system** focused only on awareness.

---

#  Our Solution

We built a **domain-controlled RAG chatbot** that:

✔ Retrieves verified crop lifecycle knowledge  
✔ Generates simplified explanations using Gemini Flash  
✔ Applies strict safety filtering  
✔ Prevents harmful agricultural advisory outputs

##  Detailed RAG Pipeline

###  Knowledge Base Layer
- Agricultural lifecycle PDF
- Clean, domain-restricted content
- No advisory data included

###  Text Chunking
- Split into small overlapping chunks
- Improves retrieval accuracy
- Reduces hallucination

###  Embedding Layer
- SentenceTransformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Converts text into numerical vectors

###  Vector Database
- FAISS IndexFlatL2
- Fast similarity search
- Lightweight and hackathon friendly

###  Retrieval Layer
- Query converted to embedding
- Top-K relevant chunks retrieved
- Context injected into prompt

###  Controlled Generation Layer
- Gemini Flash model via Google AI Studio
- Strong system instructions
- Domain-restricted output

###  Output Guard Layer
- Keyword-based restriction
- Blocks fertilizer & yield queries
- Ensures safe AI usage

#  End-to-End Usage Flow

## Step 1: User Interaction
User enters:
```
Explain irrigation cycle
```

## Step 2: Safety Filtering
System checks for restricted intent.

If restricted:
```
 I can only explain crop lifecycle and farming processes.
```

## Step 3: Query Embedding
Query converted into vector representation.

## Step 4: Similarity Search
FAISS retrieves relevant agricultural chunks.

## Step 5: Prompt Construction
Final prompt includes:
- System safety instruction
- Retrieved context
- User question

## Step 6: LLM Generation
Gemini Flash generates:
- Structured
- Simple
- Informational explanation

## Step 7: Display Output
Streamlit presents formatted answer.

#  Responsible AI Measures

This project includes multiple safety layers:

###  Query Filtering
Blocks advisory-related keywords.

###  Domain Restriction
Knowledge base excludes treatment & fertilizer content.

###  Prompt Guardrails
Strict system-level instructions.

###  No Predictive Models
No yield forecasting or optimization algorithms.

#  How to Run

##  Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Set API Key

**Mac / Linux**
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key"
```

**Windows**
```bash
set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
```

---

##  Create Vector Store

```bash
python create_vector_store.py
```

This generates:
- `vector_store.index`
- `chunks.pkl`

---

##  Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

# Impact

- Improves agricultural awareness
- Reduces misinformation
- Demonstrates safe GenAI deployment
- Assists rural knowledge dissemination
- Scalable for multilingual support

---

#  Future Enhancements

-  Multilingual support (Hindi, Telugu)
-  Voice-based assistant
-  SMS-based rural deployment
-  Crop-specific knowledge modules
-  Government agriculture portal integration

---

#  Why This Project Stands Out

✔ Responsible AI Architecture  
✔ Domain-Specific RAG Implementation  
✔ Safety-First Design  
✔ Real-World Agricultural Impact  
✔ Clean, Deployable System
